A pastor rob soundboard.

## The Pastor Rob Archive (⚠️ Abandoned)
**IMPORTANT:** This archive has been abandoned and the new way to search sermons is with the FBC Sermon Search at https://cosmocreeper.github.io/fbcss.

You can find the transcripts of every sermon Pastor Rob has ever preached on livestream (that also has a transcript on youtube) within a single .txt file. Just download our "pastor-rob-sermons.txt" and you can search for clips. The program we use to get transcripts from a playlist is available at [this GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CosmoCreeper/youtube-transcript-retriever).

Each different sermon is marked with a video ID that will take you back to youtube. If you find any cool clips from the sermons .txt, please help contribute by suggesting a new sound for the pastor rob soundboard.
